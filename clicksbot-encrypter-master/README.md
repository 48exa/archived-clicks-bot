# Clicksbot Encrypter

This folder is neccesary to build a functional version of ACB.

To use this put `clicksbot.exe` into the `releases` folder and then run `cargo run --release -- target/release/clicksbotgui.exe` to build `encrypted_clicksbot.exe`

To run the bot put it in a folder with a `silent.wav` and a `click_types` folder with *at least* one clickpack.
